# TicTacToe
A simple application to play the game of Tic Tac Toe  with two players

## Requirements

• The game must allow for two human players to compete against each other. It is<br>
assumed that the players will be using the same device, simply passing the phone back<br>
and forth until the game is complete.<br>
• The game must continue until either one player wins, or a cat’s game (a draw) is<br>
reached.<br>
• Once a game is concluded, the winner (or cat’s game) should be displayed on the<br>
screen, along with the option to restart the game.<br>
• When the app is launched, it should boot directly to a new game, or a dialog confirming<br>
the start of a new game. There’s no need for navigation, options, player vs cpu, etc.<br>
• The app can be versioned and hosted on Github, or compressed and submitted directly.<br>
In either case, please include a README.md file that contains any special instructions to<br>
build and run your project.<br>
